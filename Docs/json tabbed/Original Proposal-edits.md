h1 Project Outline
h2 OBJECTIVE
Implement a web (cloud) based system which would: log work orders (employee
hours, client information, materials billing), invoice customers, and update
accounting and payroll without a need for manual data re-entry from hardcopy.

h2 SCOPE OF SERVICES
h3 Project Overview

1. Update current website to a modern/professional look
2. Create interlinking forms and database services to eliminate manual data re-entry
3. Eliminate hardcopy and move invoice and documents to external redundant cloud based backup service
4. Provide a mobile app based using PhoneGap for remote employee work log entry with offline/online data synchronization


h4 Establish functional database:

1. main interface for data flow:
* Work order
* invoicing
* reporting
* Customer records
* Employee records
* Parts/materials records
2. Output function: PDF creation

h4 A smartphone based application interface to input current work order information. (PhoneGap)

1. Password protected employee login (Unique employee identifier)
* SPECIFY: option to bypass password protection if phone lock is enabled is my recommendation

h5 Data fields:
1. Geolocation stamping (not visible in app UI)
1. Stamped upon work order creation
2. logged in 15 minute increments
3. Log is stopped when ticket flag state is changed (Review/Specify work order states)
* Open -in progress
* Open -paused (end of shift)
* Open -Pending parts/fluids availability
* Closed -submitted complete
4. Geolocation stamp sorts potential customer by radius to location when a work order is created, customer selection is via dropdown in order of distance from geostamp (closest, next closest, next next closest, and specify)
* This option can only be implemented if customer locations are obtainable through current records. Otherwise this feature is outside the scope of this project and not included in the estimate, but can be added in the future.
2. Date:
3. Company:
4. Unit Number
5. Work Order number
6. Time in/out (up to 12 entries or specify other maximum)
7. Notes: (Please specify character length if other than 400)
8. English and Spanish user interface (UI)
9. Additional selection for job type
* Fluid Toppers (Indicate what data changes with this selection)
* Mechanics
10. list or search feature based on employee login
11. Manager credentials accesses own and subordinate work orders
* Admin credentials accesses all data through database -not app

h4 A redesigned website:

1. Modern/professional look
2. Content management
3. News
4. Content Editing
5. Home
6. About Us
7. Blog (Features must be defined)
8. Customer/Services overview
9. Contact
10. FAQ
11. Employee/Customer login
12. Administration, User Management, User profiles
13. Form interface for database input/editing
14. Employee Administration (Add/edit/delete employees, Password management, user profiles)

h2 Project review points

1. *Design review for website*
2. *Work log form design review*
3. *eForm invoicing review*
4. *Periodic progress review meetings during several stages. (30-45 minute maximum, with prepared agenda)*
5. *Pre-live testing of all software modules*

h2 Project Implementation
Upon completion of this project, and final payment, S.E.S.A. Fleet services will entirely own all rights to the entire, *compiled*, software suite, with the following exceptions:

1. Original Source Code (S.E.S.A. Fleet services has the right to modify and reuse any and all programs in any way you see fit, and upon request I will provide the entire source code, but parts of the code may be under copyright through another programming entity)
2. I retain the rights to reuse any and all algorithms and libraries which built the source code, which can be reused in future projects
3. Any previously copyrighted 3rd party software packages or code used in the creation of your software is governed by their copyright and must be used in accordance to their copyright agreement
4. If registering a domain name, hosting service, storage service etc. is required for completion of the project that, will be relinquished or transferred to S.E.S.A. Fleet services who will become completely responsible for all decisions regarding the payments, maintenance and continuation of those services.

h3 Training:
1 Provide up to three days onsite for implementation.
1. Because this program automates existing processes rather than create new ones, very little training will be needed to gain maximum benefit. The goal of training is to deliver the software to you with all the knowledge needed to incorporate this into your standard operating procedures.
2. Scope of training:
*  Expressly limited to Tino and Chris Vela
*  Potentially confidential company information (accounting procedures, datacollection, billing etc.) will be disclosed
*  Field training will be implemented by you through management and SOP's.
*  Field personnel will follow current workflows, but through an Android/iPhone application interface.
*  Telephone/Email support for the two weeks following implementation.
*  Software Bugs, *defined as programming errors made by my team* will be corrected in as timely a matter as possible.
- Must be alerted to me by telephone
- Bug reports will be submitted by email or some agreed upon traceable electronic submission.
- Bug reports can be submitted during the 6 months following live implementation.
